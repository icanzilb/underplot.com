      <title>Debug SwiftUI with a custom view modifier</title>

      <description>Logging values and seeing them visualized in dataTile is pretty powerful but the core concept of the app really shines when a developer would automate logs that drive metrics over time.
Such metrics could be any value that changes over time — the size of the app cache, consumed RAM, or how many instances of a given class are created.
In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll look into logging how many times a SwiftUI view is re-created.</description>

      <title>dataTile for Simulator 1.4</title>

      <description>dataTile for Simulator 1.4 is a minor update bringing a number of quality-of-life improvements to the app:
When you relaunch your iOS app from Xcode — dataTile for Simulator detects the restart and resets the data in the currently visible tiles so you see only the data since the latest app launch. This improvement relieves the need to add pre-run script to projects — dataTile now detects relaunches and reset the data on its own.</description>

      <title>Reroute print() to the unified log system</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re usually using print(...) in Swift to print debug info to the output console, it might be difficult to fight muscle memory and use os_log(...) instead.
Luckily, you can easily create a simple replacement for print() if you want to route some of that sweet, sweet debug info to the app logs and from there see them straight in dataTile!
Additionally, you might have some print statements sprinkled here and there and want to now capture them with dataTile&amp;hellip;</description>
