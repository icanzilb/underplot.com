      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad to share that dataTile for Simulator is launching today on ProductHunt and the AppStore today!
dataTile for Simulator is an Xcode companion app to see your debugging data in a beautiful and bold UI. Log your debug data as usual using Apple&amp;rsquo;s logging framework, and dataTile for Simulator will automatically select and display your logs!
It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful native developer tool that is focused on making developers more productive while developing with Xcode and the Simulator.</description>

Luckily, you can easily create a simple replacement for print() if you want to route some of that sweet, sweet debug info to the app logs and from there see them straight in dataTile!
Additionally, you might have some print statements sprinkled here and there and want to now capture them with dataTile&amp;hellip;</description>
